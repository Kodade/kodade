# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 1.4.15 - 2026-08-07

- Added Grok Build as a chat-capable KödChat agent through the grok CLI's
  structured headless stream, with session resume, model selection, and
  permission-mode access levels.
- Auto-titled KödChat threads: new threads read "New chat" and take a short
  topic title from the first prompt instead of a provider-numbered name.
- Moved the composer's provider, model, and access chips below the input
  surface and added a thinking-level chip for models that support one
  (claude --effort; codex model_reasoning_effort).
- Added a collapse toggle for the right files sidebar, mirroring the projects
  sidebar's rail, persisted across restarts, with a Mod+Shift+B shortcut.
- Removed the account settings tab while plans are not offered; license and
  entitlement plumbing is unchanged.
- Fixed KödChat terminals so Show terminal immediately opens a thread-owned
  split without replacing the chat or adding a workspace card.
- Opened assistant links in the editor's browser tab instead of navigating the
  entire app window away from Ködade.
- Removed the retired hosted browser application, pairing/service code, and
  deployment configuration from the desktop source tree.
- Decoupled KödLocal tools from the retired server through a fixed-root native
  tool host.
- Removed internal planning, research, and release-evidence documents and added
  a public-source privacy check to prevent them from being recommitted.
